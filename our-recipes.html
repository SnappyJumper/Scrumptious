                    <h4>Method:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 200C</li>
                        <li>Take your butternuts and cut them vertically in half, scoop out and dispose of the seeds and
                            leave the skins on.</li>
                        <li>Arrange your prepped butternuts on a baking tray skin side down and drizzle with some of
                            your oil and salt and pepper. Place in the oven to roast for about 30mins or until the flesh
                            begins to brown.</li>
                        <li>While your butternuts are roasting, take your carrots onions and celery and wash and peel
                            them where applicable. Then chop them into large chunks. Crush your garlic and set aside
                            separate from the other veg.</li>
                        <li>Next in a saucepan heat up the rest of your oil at a nice low-medium heat. Once the pan is
                            hot enough add your chopped veg and sweat(fry on low heat with no browning).Continue until
                            the onion is translucent and then add your garlic. Keep to a low heat stirring regularly to
                            be sure you don't burn the garlic. Take off the heat after 5 mins.</li>
                        <li>Once your butternuts are cooked carefully take them off the tray and remove the flesh with a
                            spoon leaving behind the skin. Place the flesh into your saucepan, return to the heat and
                            add your stock. Be sure that your stock only just covers your vegetables, if it needs more
                            just top op with water. Boil and reduce to a simmer until all the veg can be easily pierced
                            with a fork then remove from the heat and blitz.</li>
