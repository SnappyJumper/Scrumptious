# Scrumptious!



Scrumptious! is a fictional company based at a fictional location in inner city Dublin.

Scrumptious!'s aim is to provide its users with food recipes that have been tried and tested by real chefs within their own kitchens.

This website helps customers find the recipe theyre looking for and provides clear and simple instructions on how to recreate the dish at home.

The website is for new customers discovering new recipes for the first time and for returning customers who are looking for a recipe they found before or to even try something new.

The website also offers a subscription to an email newsletter which keeps customers up to date when new recipes have been posted and information about live cooking demos taking place throughout the country.

### Code Validation

* The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) online services were used to ensure there were no errors in the code like syntax issues etc...

Test on index.html:

![index test](assets/readme-images/Test%20index.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found a /nav ending which was outside the div containing the nav. I fixed this error by moving the /nav to the correct location within the div.

- There was also a div id with an empty string associated with it. I deleted the unused id.

- There was a warning asking me to add some headers to the social media and contact us sections of the footer. I added hidden headings to correct this.

- The results of these adjustments gave a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on our-recipes.html:

![our recipes test 1](assets/readme-images/Test%20our-recipes%20pt.1.png)
![our recipes test 2](assets/readme-images/Test%20our-recipes%20pt.2.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found that the sections for the circle images had no headings so I added them.

- There was a unused /i which i deleted.

- The same warning as the initial results from the index.html test suggested I added headings to the social network and contact us section so I did.

- The results of these adjustments gave a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on newsletter.html:

![newsletter test](assets/readme-images/Test%20newsletter%20.png)
![button warning](assets/readme-images/button-warning.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found that I had an unused /div so i deleted it.

- The same warning arose with the footer as in the previous tests. I added headings to the social network and contact us sections to rectify the warning.

- There was also a warning with my button which i corrected by removing the role attribute.

- The results of these adjustments resulted in a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on style.css:

![css test](assets/readme-images/Test%20css.png)
