# Scrumptious!



Scrumptious! is a fictional company based at a fictional location in inner city Dublin.

Scrumptious!'s aim is to provide its users with food recipes that have been tried and tested by real chefs within their own kitchens.

This website helps customers find the recipe theyre looking for and provides clear and simple instructions on how to recreate the dish at home.

The website is for new customers discovering new recipes for the first time and for returning customers who are looking for a recipe they found before or to even try something new.

The website also offers a subscription to an email newsletter which keeps customers up to date when new recipes have been posted and information about live cooking demos taking place throughout the country.
