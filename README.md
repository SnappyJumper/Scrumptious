# Scrumptious!

![Scrumptious Responsive Image](assets/readme-images/responsive-image.png)

Scrumptious! is a fictional company based at a fictional location in inner city Dublin.

Scrumptious!'s aim is to provide its users with food recipes that have been tried and tested by real chefs within their own kitchens.

This website helps customers find the recipe they're looking for and provides clear and simple instructions on how to recreate the dish at home.

The website is for new customers discovering new recipes for the first time and for returning customers who are looking for a recipe they found before or to even try something new.

The website also offers a subscription to an email newsletter which keeps customers up to date when new recipes have been posted and information about live cooking demos taking place throughout the country.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* The website should have a bright appearance with colors resembling that of fresh produce.

* Introduce the customer to what the company goals are.

* Present the recipes in a neat format with easy to understand instructions.

* Provide the customer with information that can help facilitate greater communication with the company.

* Offer the customers the opportunity to sign up to a Newsletter where they can recieve updates on new recipes and upcoming events.

### User Stories

* As a customer, I want to be able to navigate the website easily and discover new recipes.

* As a customer, I want to be able to read more about what the company offers me.

* As a customer, I want to easily find the contact information for the business.

* As a customer, I want to find social media links associated with the business.

* As a customer, I want to feel assured that these recipes are tried and tested.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-images/colour-pallet.png)

The colours used on the website are above. I used the two shades of green, India Green and Kelly Green(#028A0F and #03AC15), to colour the headings and the nav bar in the mobile version of the site respectively. I used the shade of Red Carmine to colour the banners and boxes throughout the website as well as the email link within the footer. These colours were chosen because of their familiar shades to fresh produce like peppers and brocolli. For the text I stuck with a white colour (#FFFFFF). 

### Typography

The main font used on the website is "Karla", from google fonts, with sans-serif as backup in case the font fails to display. The logo and headings are all styled with "Poetsen One", with sans-serif as a fall back again.  

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to help plan the finished look of the website and the wireframes I generated can be viewed below

## Features

### General

* Design was to be responsive across multiple devices.

* Colour schemes and similar layouts were to be maintained across all devices to enhance the user experience and make it easy to access information across different devices.

**Header**

Desktop Header:

![Desktop Header image](assets/readme-images/desktop-header.png)

Mobile Header with Nav hidden:

![Mobile Header image 1](assets/readme-images/mobile-header-nav-hidden.png)

Mobile Header with Nav shown:

![Mobile Header image 2](assets/readme-images/mobile-header-nav-visable.png)

    
- The header contains the company logo, which also serves as a link to the home page, and a fully functional navigation bar for moving between the pages of the website. 

- The header is fixed to the top of the window for easy access wherever you are on the page. 

- The navigation bar is the same across all pages and highlights the active page, which helps users know where they are as they browse the site.

- The links in the navigation bar have a hover effect applied to them to enhance the user experience.

- The navigation bar hides itself on smaller devices and can be accessed using a burger button. This is useful as the nav bar takes up a lot of horizontal space and having it hidden means the header can stay small and not impact the screen space.
 

**Footer**

Desktop Footer:

![Desktop Footer image](assets/readme-images/desktop-footer.png)

Mobile Footer:

![Mobile Footer image](assets/readme-images/mobile-footer.png)

- The footer contains links to social media sites. These links highlight when you hover over with the cursor and each link is displayed as an icon relating to the relative social media site.

- Clicking one of the social media icons opens up the corresponding site in a separate tab. This is a useful feature so the customer can easily navigate back to the Scrumptious! site via the old tab.

- The footer has contact information for the company, with a clickable link for email. The link opens up the customers default email program and starts a new mail with the sites email as it's recipient. This feature is good for the user experience.

### Home Page

 **Main Image**

Desktop Main Images:

![Main image](assets/readme-images/hero-images-desktop.png)

Mobile Main Images:

![Main image mobile 1](assets/readme-images/hero-image-mobile-1.png)


![Main image mobile 2](assets/readme-images/hero-image-mobile-2.png)

- The two main images are designed to attract the customers attention and to let them know that this website is about food.

- Two images were chosen so the customer knows that the site is about more than just desserts. The ramen hero image shows that the site also has recipes for savory dishes, as well as sweet ones depicted with the brownie hero image. 

 **About Us Section**

Desktop Version:

![About us section desktop image](assets/readme-images/about-us-desktop.png)

Mobile Version:

![About us section mobile image](assets/readme-images/about-us-mobile.png)

- The rest of the page consists of eye-catching images with brief descriptions. These outline what the company's goals are and what the function of this website is.

- The first paragraph talks about the aim of the site. To match the customer with a recipe that has been tried and tested by our own chefs. This gives the customer a solid idea of what to expect from the site.

- This is coupled with an image of one of the chefs musing over some of the fantastic recipes he's testing that day.

- The second paragraph talks about Nutrition. It explains that all the recipes are put together with good nutrition at their core. This reassures the customers that the recipes supplied are going to be healthy which entices more health concerned customers to the site.

- This is coupled with an image of fresh produce to compliment the idea of a balanced diet and healthy nutrition.

- The Third paragraph talks about the cooking demos. These cooking demos offer customers an opportunity to get some hands on experience with the recipes. The paragraph also mentions the newsletter to get more information. Mentioning the newsletter will encourage customers to navigate further into the site.


### Our Recipes Page

![Our Recipes Hero Image](assets/readme-images/our-recipes-hero.png)

- The page begins with a hero image displaying a set table ready for a dinner party. This provides the customer with an idea where they can use the recipes below.

 **Sample Menu**

Recipe Container:

![Recipe Template Image](assets/readme-images/recipe-example.png)

Accompanying Image:

![Accompanying Image Of Dish](assets/readme-images/recipe-image.png)

- Until more recipes are gathered for the database the website shows a sample three course menu for a dinner party. In future this page will serve as a base to navigate to recipes throughout the site across all types of courses.

- There is one specially selected meal for each of the three courses. A starter, a main and a dessert. This gives the customer some range and reminds them that the site will host a diverse selection of recipes in the future

- Each recipe is responsive and can be easily replicated to hold other recipes when adding more down the line. This enhances the user experience on mobile devices and makes it useful for the site owner when adding recipes, as there will be an existing template to work off of.

- Each recipe has a section for the ingredients, the cooking information and the instructions. They are laid out neatly for easy reading. This is key as the accessibility of each recipe to the customer is part of the main goals of the site.

- Each recipe also has an accompanying image of the finished product. This is essential not only for the customer to be able to compare their work but also to entice them to try the recipe.

### Newsletter Page

[Newsletter Hero Image](assets/readme-images/newsletter-hero.png)

- The hero image on the newsletter page shows a chef hard at work kneading dough. 

- Below the heading of the page we also have a paragraph about what the newsletter offers the customer. This will help to encourage customers to sign up which in turn will encourage repeat visits to the site.

 **Get Onboard Form**

Desktop Version:

![Get Onboard Form](assets/readme-images/get-onboard-form-desktop.png)

Mobile Version:

![Get Onboard Form image](assets/readme-images/get-onboard-form-mobile.png)

- The form allows the customer to submit their information, so they can receive our newsletter. 

- Everything is laid out nice and easy and the sign up is kept nice and simple with a name, surname and email input and a radio button selection on the customers favourite course. Keeping this simple is essential as lengthly signup pages can discourage customers.

- The radio button selection will help deliver a more personalised experience further down the line. The newsletter could be adapted to lean heavier on the customers preferred course.

- The newsletter keeps them up to date with the recipes on the site and gives them information on live cooking demos taking place throughout the country. The more up to date the customer is with the latest recipes and events posted on the site, the larger return visits the site will have as a result.

- The form is accompanied by an image of food being seasoned.

### Code Validation

* The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) online services were used to ensure there were no errors in the code like syntax issues etc...

Test on index.html:

![index test](assets/readme-images/test-index.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found a /nav ending which was outside the div containing the nav. I fixed this error by moving the /nav to the correct location within the div.

- There was also a div id with an empty string associated with it. I deleted the unused id.

- There was a warning asking me to add some headers to the social media and contact us sections of the footer. I added hidden headings to correct this.

- The results of these adjustments gave a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on our-recipes.html:

![our recipes test 1](assets/readme-images/test-our-recipes-pt.1.png)
![our recipes test 2](assets/readme-images/test-our-recipes-pt.2.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found that the sections for the circle images had no headings, so I added them.

- There was a unused /i which i deleted.

- The same warning as the initial results from the index.html test suggested I added headings to the social network and contact us section, so I did.

- The results of these adjustments gave a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on newsletter.html:

![newsletter test](assets/readme-images/test-newsletter.png)
![button warning](assets/readme-images/button-warning.png)

- The W3C Markup Validator found that I had an unused /div so i deleted it.

- The same warning arose with the footer as in the previous tests. I added headings to the social network and contact us sections to rectify the warning.

- There was also a warning with my button which i corrected by removing the role attribute.

- The results of these adjustments resulted in a no errors or warnings result when the test was repeated.

Test on style.css:
